INTERVIEW INTERFACE OVERVIEW

The code implements an interactive mock interview system using Gradio. Here's a detailed overview of the interface and its components:

->Gradio Interface Components
      Input Fields for Initial Details:
            Topic Input: A text box for the user to enter the topic of the interview.
            Position Input: A text box for the user to specify the position they are interviewing for.
            Difficulty Input: A radio button selection allowing the user to choose the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).

      Start Button:
            Start Interview Button: Initiates the interview process, generating the first question and preparing the system to handle user responses.

      Output Components:
            Question Output: A text box that displays the current interview question.
            Audio Output: An audio player to play the synthesized speech of the current interview question.
            Handle Answer Output: A hidden state to manage and pass the answer-handling function across interactions.
            Audio Input: An audio recorder for the user to submit their spoken answer.
            Video Input: A video recorder for the user to submit a video, used for sentiment analysis.
            Transcribed Output: A text box to display the transcribed version of the user's spoken answer.
            Sentiment Output: A text box to display the result of sentiment analysis from the submitted video.

      Submit Button:
      Submit Answer Button: Allows the user to submit their answer. This triggers the evaluation of the answer, sentiment analysis (if a video is provided), and generates the next question or feedback.


->Workflow
      Starting the Interview:
            The user enters the topic, position, and difficulty level.
            The user clicks the "Start Interview" button.
            The system generates the first question and plays its audio.

      Answer Submission:
            The user records their answer using the audio input (and optionally, a video input for sentiment analysis).
            The user clicks the "Submit Answer" button.
            The system processes the audio to transcribe the user's answer.
            If a video is provided, sentiment analysis is performed on the video.
            The system evaluates the answer, provides feedback, hints if necessary, and generates the next question.

      Real-Time Interaction:
            The interface dynamically updates with each interaction, displaying the next question and playing its audio.
            The system maintains a conversation history, updating the user on their performance and guiding them through the interview process.

->Backend Processes
      Question Generation: Utilizes the Hugging Face language model to generate interview questions tailored to the provided topic, position, and difficulty.
      Answer Verification: Evaluates user answers against the expected responses, providing immediate feedback and hints if necessary.
      Speech Synthesis: Converts text questions and feedback into speech for a more immersive experience.
      Speech Recognition: Transcribes user answers from audio inputs.
      Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes facial expressions from the user's video to infer sentiments and potentially influence the interview flow.
      Feedback Generation: Provides detailed feedback on the user's overall performance, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

This interactive interface simulates a realistic interview environment, offering comprehensive practice and feedback to users preparing for actual interviews.

### Model Configuration

The code uses various models and services integrated through the Hugging Face Hub and other APIs to facilitate the mock interview. Hereâ€™s a summary of the model configurations and integrations:

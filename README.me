Welcome to the AI Mock Interviewer!

The provided code defines a sophisticated AI mock interviewer using a combination of Gradio, Speech Recognition, Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), and the Hugging Face Inference API. This model is designed to simulate a realistic interview environment, allowing users to practice and improve their interview skills. 

=>Key Components

1. InferenceClient Setup:
        *Sets up the client to interact with the Meta-Llama model hosted on Hugging Face using an API token.

2.Prompt Generation:
        *get_system_prompt(topic): Creates a system prompt defining the AI’s role as an expert interviewer.
        *generate_question(...): Generates interview questions based on the topic, position, and difficulty level, ensuring no repetition.

3.Answer Verification and Hints:
        *verify_answer(...): Verifies the user's answer and provides feedback.
        *generate_hint(...): Generates hints for the user without revealing the answer.
        *get_correct_answer(...): Provides the correct answer if the user’s response is incorrect.

4.Text-to-Speech and Speech Recognition:
        *speak(text): Converts text to speech using gTTS and saves it as an MP3 file.
        *play_audio(filename): Plays the generated audio file.
        *recognize_speech(audio_file): Converts speech from an audio file to text using the Google Speech Recognition API.

5.Interview Flow and Feedback:
        *welcome_message(): Welcomes the user to the mock interview.
        *get_user_name(): Collects and greets the user by name.
        *generate_feedback(...): Provides constructive feedback based on the user's performance throughout the interview.
        *conduct_interview(...): Manages the overall interview process, including generating questions, handling user answers, and providing feedback.

6.Gradio Interface:
        *gradio_interface(topic, position, difficulty): Sets up the Gradio interface for interacting with the user, including displaying questions, accepting audio         answers, and providing feedback.
